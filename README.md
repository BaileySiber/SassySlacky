# SassySlacky
Created a Slack scheduler bot named Sassy Slacky using Google Calendar, Slack, and DialogueFlow APIs

Features:
1. Ask Sassy to create a reminder, the reminder will be added to your Google Calendar as an all day event
2. Ask Sassy to create a meeting, the meeting will be added to your Google Calendar as well as the calendars of anyone you invited (prompt will request that you submit a slack Id, ie: @Bailey)
3. Sassy will return an alert when there is a scheduling conflict
